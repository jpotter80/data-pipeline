Based on the following data analysis, generate SQL transformations to address the identified issues and implement the suggested improvements:

        Thank you for providing this detailed information about the CSV structure. I'll analyze it and provide insights as requested.

1. Summary of the data:

This dataset appears to be a voter registration database, likely for a county or state in North Carolina. It contains 168,660 records with 30 columns, including personal information, address details, and various jurisdiction codes. The data includes:

- Voter identification (OBJECTID, VoterRegistrationNumber)
- Personal details (Name, Status, Party affiliation, Race, Gender, Age)
- Address information (Residential and Mailing)
- Various jurisdiction codes (Precinct, Municipality, Congressional District, etc.)
- Contact information (Telephone number)

2. Potential data quality issues:

a) Missing values:
   - NameMiddle: 9,348 null values (5.5% of records)
   - NameSuffix: 162,138 null values (96.1% of records)
   - ResidentialAddressUnit: 143,147 null values (84.9% of records)
   - JurisdictionMunicipalityCode: 92,880 null values (55.1% of records)
   - TelephoneFullNumber: 30,152 null values (17.9% of records)
   - JurisdictionWaterDistrictCode: 165,047 null values (97.9% of records)

b) Inconsistent data types:
   - RegistrationDate is stored as an object (string) instead of a datetime type
   - JurisdictionPrecinctCode is stored as a float instead of an integer or string
   - ResidentialAddressZipCode is stored as a float instead of a string or integer
   - TelephoneFullNumber is stored as a float instead of a string

c) Potential data integrity issues:
   - Some jurisdiction codes (PrecinctCode, CongDisCode, etc.) have 293 null values consistently
   - GenderCode has 1 null value, which should be investigated

3. Suggestions for data cleaning and normalization:

a) Handle missing values:
   - For columns like NameMiddle, NameSuffix, and ResidentialAddressUnit, consider if null values are acceptable or if they should be filled with a placeholder (e.g., "N/A").
   - Investigate the reason for missing JurisdictionMunicipalityCode and consider if it's related to rural areas.
   - For TelephoneFullNumber, decide if missing values are acceptable or if they should be collected.
   - For JurisdictionWaterDistrictCode, determine if this field is relevant for all voters or if it can be removed.

b) Data type conversions:
   - Convert RegistrationDate to a datetime type for easier date-based operations.
   - Convert JurisdictionPrecinctCode to an appropriate integer or string type.
   - Convert ResidentialAddressZipCode to a string to preserve leading zeros.
   - Convert TelephoneFullNumber to a string and format it consistently (e.g., (XXX) XXX-XXXX).

c) Data normalization:
   - Consider splitting ResidentialAddressCityStateZip into separate columns for City, State, and Zip.
   - Normalize address fields to ensure consistency (e.g., standardize abbreviations like "St." vs "Street").
   - Create a separate table for jurisdiction codes to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

d) Data validation:
   - Implement checks for valid age ranges, zip codes, and phone numbers.
   - Ensure all StatusCode, PartyCode, RaceCode, and GenderCode values are within expected ranges.
   - Verify that RegistrationDate is not in the future and is within a reasonable range.

e) Indexing:
   - Create indexes on frequently queried columns like VoterRegistrationNumber, NameLast, and ZipCode to improve query performance.

f) Documentation:
   - Create a data dictionary explaining the meaning of each column and any codes used (e.g., StatusCode, PartyCode).
   - Document any data cleaning and normalization steps taken for future reference.

By implementing these suggestions, you can improve the overall quality, consistency, and usability of the voter registration dataset.

        Please provide:
        1. SQL statements for data cleaning
        2. SQL statements for data normalization
        3. Any additional SQL transformations that would improve data quality

AI Response:
Certainly! I'll provide SQL statements for data cleaning, normalization, and additional transformations to improve data quality based on the analysis. We'll assume the table name is "voter_registration" for these examples.

1. SQL statements for data cleaning:

```sql
-- Convert data types
ALTER TABLE voter_registration
ALTER COLUMN RegistrationDate TYPE DATE USING RegistrationDate::DATE,
ALTER COLUMN JurisdictionPrecinctCode TYPE INTEGER USING JurisdictionPrecinctCode::INTEGER,
ALTER COLUMN ResidentialAddressZipCode TYPE VARCHAR(10),
ALTER COLUMN TelephoneFullNumber TYPE VARCHAR(20);

-- Handle missing values
UPDATE voter_registration
SET NameMiddle = 'N/A' WHERE NameMiddle IS NULL;

UPDATE voter_registration
SET NameSuffix = 'N/A' WHERE NameSuffix IS NULL;

UPDATE voter_registration
SET ResidentialAddressUnit = 'N/A' WHERE ResidentialAddressUnit IS NULL;

-- Format phone numbers consistently
UPDATE voter_registration
SET TelephoneFullNumber = CONCAT('(', SUBSTRING(TelephoneFullNumber, 1, 3), ') ',
                                 SUBSTRING(TelephoneFullNumber, 4, 3), '-',
                                 SUBSTRING(TelephoneFullNumber, 7, 4))
WHERE TelephoneFullNumber IS NOT NULL AND LENGTH(TelephoneFullNumber) = 10;

-- Remove invalid records
DELETE FROM voter_registration
WHERE StatusCode IS NULL OR PartyCode IS NULL OR RaceCode IS NULL OR GenderCode IS NULL;

-- Validate age range
DELETE FROM voter_registration
WHERE Age < 18 OR Age > 120;

-- Validate registration date
DELETE FROM voter_registration
WHERE RegistrationDate > CURRENT_DATE OR RegistrationDate < '1900-01-01';
```

2. SQL statements for data normalization:

```sql
-- Split ResidentialAddressCityStateZip into separate columns
ALTER TABLE voter_registration
ADD COLUMN ResidentialAddressCity VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN ResidentialAddressState VARCHAR(2),
ADD COLUMN ResidentialAddressZip VARCHAR(10);

UPDATE voter_registration
SET ResidentialAddressCity = SPLIT_PART(ResidentialAddressCityStateZip, ', ', 1),
    ResidentialAddressState = SUBSTRING(SPLIT_PART(ResidentialAddressCityStateZip, ', ', 2) FROM 1 FOR 2),
    ResidentialAddressZip = SPLIT_PART(ResidentialAddressCityStateZip, ' ', -1);

-- Create a separate table for jurisdiction codes
CREATE TABLE jurisdiction_codes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    voter_id INTEGER,
    precinct_code INTEGER,
    municipality_code VARCHAR(10),
    cong_dis_code INTEGER,
    nc_sen_code INTEGER,
    nc_house_code INTEGER,
    county_commiss_code INTEGER,
    school_dist_code INTEGER,
    water_dist_code VARCHAR(10)
);

INSERT INTO jurisdiction_codes (voter_id, precinct_code, municipality_code, cong_dis_code, nc_sen_code, nc_house_code, county_commiss_code, school_dist_code, water_dist_code)
SELECT OBJECTID, JurisdictionPrecinctCode, JurisdictionMunicipalityCode, JurisdictionCongDisCode, JurisdictionNCSenCode, JurisdictionNCHouseCode, JurisdictionCountyCommissCode, JurisdictionSchoolDistCode, JurisdictionWaterDistrictCode
FROM voter_registration;

-- Remove jurisdiction columns from the main table
ALTER TABLE voter_registration
DROP COLUMN JurisdictionPrecinctCode,
DROP COLUMN JurisdictionMunicipalityCode,
DROP COLUMN JurisdictionCongDisCode,
DROP COLUMN JurisdictionNCSenCode,
DROP COLUMN JurisdictionNCHouseCode,
DROP COLUMN JurisdictionCountyCommissCode,
DROP COLUMN JurisdictionSchoolDistCode,
DROP COLUMN JurisdictionWaterDistrictCode;
```
