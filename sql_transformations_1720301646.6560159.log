Based on the following data analysis, generate SQL transformations to address the identified issues and implement the suggested improvements:

        Thank you for providing this detailed CSV structure. I'll analyze it and provide you with a summary, potential data quality issues, and suggestions for data cleaning and normalization.

1. Summary of the data:

The dataset appears to contain baseball batting statistics for 214 players. It includes 18 columns with various metrics related to batting performance. Key points:

- Player identification: 'id' (numeric) and 'name' (text) columns
- Swing metrics: counts and percentages of competitive swings, contact, hard swings, and whiffs
- Performance metrics: squared up hits, blast hits, swing length, and batter run value
- Derived metrics: various per-swing and per-contact ratios

The data types include integers (int64), floats (float64), and strings (object).

2. Potential data quality issues:

a) No missing values: The 'null_count' is consistently 0 across all columns, which is unusually perfect. This might indicate:
   - Excellent data collection practices
   - Pre-processing that removed or imputed missing values
   - Potential issues in null detection

b) Outliers: Some columns show wide ranges that might include outliers:
   - 'batter_run_value' ranges from -29.89 to 31.95
   - 'whiffs' has a maximum of 216, which is significantly higher than the mean of 105.55

c) Inconsistent scaling: Some percentage columns are in decimal form (0-1 range), while others might be in percentage form (0-100 range).

d) Potential redundancy: Some columns appear to be derived from others (e.g., 'whiff_per_swing' likely derived from 'whiffs' and 'swings_competitive').

3. Suggestions for data cleaning and normalization:

a) Verify data completeness:
   - Double-check the data collection process to confirm the lack of missing values
   - If appropriate, consider adding a data quality flag to indicate imputed or estimated values

b) Handle outliers:
   - For 'batter_run_value' and 'whiffs', investigate extreme values to determine if they're valid or errors
   - Consider using robust statistics (median, IQR) for summary measures
   - Potentially cap extreme values or use winsorization for analysis purposes

c) Normalize percentage columns:
   - Ensure all percentage columns use the same scale (preferably 0-1)
   - Columns to check: 'percent_swings_competitive', 'hard_swing_rate', all '*_per_*' columns

d) Feature engineering:
   - Consider creating aggregate performance metrics
   - Evaluate the necessity of derived columns; some may be redundant for analysis

e) Standardization:
   - For machine learning purposes, consider standardizing numeric columns to have zero mean and unit variance

f) Data type optimization:
   - The 'id' column could potentially be stored as an integer instead of float
   - Ensure 'name' is stored as a categorical variable if appropriate

g) Consistency checks:
   - Verify that counts and derived percentages align (e.g., 'whiffs' / 'swings_competitive' should equal 'whiff_per_swing')
   - Ensure 'batted_ball_events' + 'whiffs' = 'contact' for each player

h) Documentation:
   - Create a data dictionary explaining each column, its units, and calculation method
   - Document any cleaning or normalization steps taken

i) Time-based analysis:
   - If this data represents a specific time period, consider adding date information for temporal analysis

By addressing these points, you can improve the data quality and prepare it for more robust analysis and modeling. Remember to document all changes made during the cleaning and normalization process.

        Please provide:
        1. SQL statements for data cleaning
        2. SQL statements for data normalization
        3. Any additional SQL transformations that would improve data quality

AI Response:
Certainly! Based on the data analysis provided, I'll generate SQL statements for data cleaning, normalization, and additional transformations to improve data quality. I'll assume we're working with a table named 'baseball_stats' for these examples.

1. SQL statements for data cleaning:

```sql
-- Handle outliers in batter_run_value
UPDATE baseball_stats
SET batter_run_value = 
    CASE 
        WHEN batter_run_value < -30 THEN -30
        WHEN batter_run_value > 32 THEN 32
        ELSE batter_run_value
    END;

-- Handle outliers in whiffs
UPDATE baseball_stats
SET whiffs = 
    CASE 
        WHEN whiffs > 200 THEN 200
        ELSE whiffs
    END;

-- Convert id to integer
ALTER TABLE baseball_stats
ALTER COLUMN id TYPE INTEGER;

-- Add a data quality flag column
ALTER TABLE baseball_stats
ADD COLUMN data_quality_flag VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'OK';

-- Flag potential data quality issues
UPDATE baseball_stats
SET data_quality_flag = 'CHECK'
WHERE whiffs > 150 OR batter_run_value < -20 OR batter_run_value > 20;
```

2. SQL statements for data normalization:

```sql
-- Ensure all percentage columns use 0-1 scale
UPDATE baseball_stats
SET percent_swings_competitive = percent_swings_competitive / 100
WHERE percent_swings_competitive > 1;

UPDATE baseball_stats
SET hard_swing_rate = hard_swing_rate / 100
WHERE hard_swing_rate > 1;

-- Standardize numeric columns (example for batter_run_value)
WITH stats AS (
    SELECT AVG(batter_run_value) AS mean, STDDEV(batter_run_value) AS std
    FROM baseball_stats
)
UPDATE baseball_stats
SET batter_run_value_standardized = (batter_run_value - stats.mean) / NULLIF(stats.std, 0)
FROM stats;

-- Repeat the above for other relevant numeric columns
```

3. Additional SQL transformations to improve data quality:

```sql
-- Consistency check: whiff_per_swing
UPDATE baseball_stats
SET whiff_per_swing = ROUND(CAST(whiffs AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(swings_competitive, 0), 4)
WHERE ABS(whiff_per_swing - (CAST(whiffs AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(swings_competitive, 0))) > 0.0001;

-- Consistency check: batted_ball_events + whiffs = contact
UPDATE baseball_stats
SET data_quality_flag = 
    CASE 
        WHEN batted_ball_events + whiffs != contact THEN 'INCONSISTENT'
        ELSE data_quality_flag
    END;

-- Create an aggregate performance metric
ALTER TABLE baseball_stats
ADD COLUMN performance_score FLOAT;

UPDATE baseball_stats
SET performance_score = 
    (COALESCE(batter_run_value, 0) / 10) +
    (COALESCE(contact_per_swing, 0) * 2) +
    (COALESCE(hard_swing_rate, 0) * 2) -
    (COALESCE(whiff_per_swing, 0) * 2);

-- Convert 'name' to a categorical variable (if using PostgreSQL)
ALTER TABLE baseball_stats
ALTER COLUMN name TYPE VARCHAR(100);

CREATE INDEX idx_name ON baseball_stats (name);

-- Add a timestamp column for future temporal analysis
ALTER TABLE baseball_stats
ADD COLUMN data_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

-- Create a view with key performance indicators
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW player_kpi AS
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    batter_run_value,
    contact_per_swing,
    hard_swing_rate,
    whiff_per_swing,
    performance_score,
    data_quality_flag
FROM baseball_stats;
```

These SQL transformations address the main points raised in the data analysis:

1. They handle outliers in 'batter_run_value' and 'whiffs'.
2.
