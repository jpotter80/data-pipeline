Based on the following data analysis, generate SQL transformations to address the identified issues and implement the suggested improvements:

        Thank you for providing this detailed information about the CSV structure. I'll provide a summary, discuss potential data quality issues, and offer suggestions for data cleaning and normalization.

1. Summary of the data:

This dataset appears to be a voter registration database, likely for a specific county or region in North Carolina. It contains 168,660 records with 30 columns, including personal information (name, address, phone number), voter registration details (registration number, date, status), demographic information (age, gender, race), and various jurisdiction codes for electoral districts.

Key points:
- The data includes both residential and mailing addresses
- It contains party affiliation (PartyCode) and voter status (StatusCode)
- There are multiple jurisdiction codes for different levels of government representation
- The dataset includes age and registration date information

2. Potential data quality issues:

a) Missing data:
- NameMiddle: 9,348 null values (5.5% of records)
- NameSuffix: 162,138 null values (96.1% of records)
- ResidentialAddressUnit: 143,147 null values (84.9% of records)
- JurisdictionMunicipalityCode: 92,880 null values (55.1% of records)
- TelephoneFullNumber: 30,152 null values (17.9% of records)
- JurisdictionWaterDistrictCode: 165,047 null values (97.9% of records)

b) Data type inconsistencies:
- RegistrationDate is stored as an object (string) instead of a date type
- Some numeric fields (e.g., JurisdictionPrecinctCode, ResidentialAddressZipCode) are stored as floats instead of integers
- TelephoneFullNumber is stored as a float, which may lead to precision issues

c) Potential data accuracy issues:
- AgeAtYearEnd might not be current and could require updating
- Address information might be outdated for some voters

d) Redundant data:
- NameLastFirstMiddle contains information already present in separate fields

3. Suggestions for data cleaning and normalization:

a) Handle missing data:
- For fields like NameMiddle, NameSuffix, and ResidentialAddressUnit, consider if null values are acceptable or if they should be filled with a default value (e.g., 'N/A' or 'NONE')
- Investigate the high number of null values in JurisdictionMunicipalityCode and JurisdictionWaterDistrictCode to determine if this is expected or if there's an issue with data collection

b) Data type conversions:
- Convert RegistrationDate to a proper date type
- Convert JurisdictionPrecinctCode and ResidentialAddressZipCode to integers
- Consider storing TelephoneFullNumber as a string to preserve leading zeros and formatting

c) Data validation and standardization:
- Implement checks for age validity and update AgeAtYearEnd if necessary
- Standardize address formats for consistency
- Validate and standardize phone number formats

d) Normalization:
- Consider creating separate tables for jurisdictions and linking them via foreign keys to reduce redundancy
- Create a separate table for addresses, linking both residential and mailing addresses to the main voter record

e) Remove redundant data:
- Consider removing the NameLastFirstMiddle field, as it's a concatenation of other fields

f) Enhance data usability:
- Add computed fields like "YearsRegistered" based on RegistrationDate
- Create categorical age groups for easier analysis

g) Implement data quality checks:
- Ensure all StatusCode and PartyCode values are valid
- Verify that JurisdictionCongDisCode and other district codes are valid and up-to-date

h) Documentation:
- Create a data dictionary explaining the meaning of codes (e.g., StatusCode, PartyCode, RaceCode)
- Document any data transformations or cleaning processes for future reference

By addressing these issues and implementing these suggestions, you can significantly improve the quality, consistency, and usability of this voter registration dataset.

        Please provide:
        1. SQL statements for data cleaning
        2. SQL statements for data normalization
        3. Any additional SQL transformations that would improve data quality

AI Response:
Certainly! I'll provide SQL statements for data cleaning, normalization, and additional transformations to improve data quality based on the analysis. We'll assume the original table is named `voter_registration`.

1. SQL statements for data cleaning:

```sql
-- Create a new table with cleaned data
CREATE TABLE cleaned_voter_registration AS
SELECT
    RegistrationNumber,
    COALESCE(NameFirst, '') AS NameFirst,
    COALESCE(NameMiddle, '') AS NameMiddle,
    COALESCE(NameLast, '') AS NameLast,
    COALESCE(NameSuffix, 'N/A') AS NameSuffix,
    CAST(RegistrationDate AS DATE) AS RegistrationDate,
    CAST(AgeAtYearEnd AS INTEGER) AS AgeAtYearEnd,
    CASE 
        WHEN AgeAtYearEnd < 18 OR AgeAtYearEnd > 120 THEN NULL
        ELSE AgeAtYearEnd
    END AS ValidatedAge,
    StatusCode,
    PartyCode,
    RaceCode,
    GenderCode,
    CAST(ResidentialAddressNumber AS INTEGER) AS ResidentialAddressNumber,
    ResidentialAddressStreet,
    COALESCE(ResidentialAddressUnit, 'N/A') AS ResidentialAddressUnit,
    ResidentialAddressCity,
    ResidentialAddressState,
    CAST(ResidentialAddressZipCode AS INTEGER) AS ResidentialAddressZipCode,
    MailingAddressNumber,
    MailingAddressStreet,
    MailingAddressUnit,
    MailingAddressCity,
    MailingAddressState,
    MailingAddressZipCode,
    REGEXP_REPLACE(CAST(TelephoneFullNumber AS VARCHAR), '[^0-9]', '') AS TelephoneFullNumber,
    CAST(JurisdictionPrecinctCode AS INTEGER) AS JurisdictionPrecinctCode,
    COALESCE(JurisdictionMunicipalityCode, 'N/A') AS JurisdictionMunicipalityCode,
    JurisdictionCongDisCode,
    JurisdictionNCHouseDisCode,
    JurisdictionNCSenateDisCode,
    COALESCE(JurisdictionWaterDistrictCode, 'N/A') AS JurisdictionWaterDistrictCode
FROM voter_registration;

-- Create indexes for improved query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_registration_number ON cleaned_voter_registration(RegistrationNumber);
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON cleaned_voter_registration(NameLast, NameFirst, NameMiddle);
CREATE INDEX idx_registration_date ON cleaned_voter_registration(RegistrationDate);
```

2. SQL statements for data normalization:

```sql
-- Create a normalized address table
CREATE TABLE addresses AS
SELECT DISTINCT
    RegistrationNumber,
    'Residential' AS AddressType,
    ResidentialAddressNumber AS AddressNumber,
    ResidentialAddressStreet AS AddressStreet,
    ResidentialAddressUnit AS AddressUnit,
    ResidentialAddressCity AS AddressCity,
    ResidentialAddressState AS AddressState,
    ResidentialAddressZipCode AS AddressZipCode
FROM cleaned_voter_registration
UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT
    RegistrationNumber,
    'Mailing' AS AddressType,
    MailingAddressNumber AS AddressNumber,
    MailingAddressStreet AS AddressStreet,
    MailingAddressUnit AS AddressUnit,
    MailingAddressCity AS AddressCity,
    MailingAddressState AS AddressState,
    MailingAddressZipCode AS AddressZipCode
FROM cleaned_voter_registration
WHERE MailingAddressStreet IS NOT NULL;

-- Create a normalized jurisdiction table
CREATE TABLE jurisdictions AS
SELECT DISTINCT
    RegistrationNumber,
    JurisdictionPrecinctCode,
    JurisdictionMunicipalityCode,
    JurisdictionCongDisCode,
    JurisdictionNCHouseDisCode,
