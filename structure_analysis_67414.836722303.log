        Please provide:
        1. A summary of the data
        2. Potential data quality issues
        3. Suggestions for data cleaning and normalization

AI Response:
Thank you for providing this detailed information about the CSV structure. I'll provide a summary, discuss potential data quality issues, and offer suggestions for data cleaning and normalization.

1. Summary of the data:

This dataset appears to be a collection of information about 1000 movies, including:
- Ranking
- Release year
- Duration
- Age limit
- Rating
- Number of ratings
- Metascore
- Description
- Movie name

Key observations:
- The data spans movies from 1920 to 2024
- Ratings range from 7.6 to 9.3
- Metascores range from 28 to 100
- The dataset includes a mix of numerical and categorical data

2. Potential data quality issues:

a) Inconsistent data types:
   - 'duration' is stored as a string (e.g., "2h 22m") instead of a numerical value
   - 'age_limit' is stored as a string with mixed formats (e.g., "15", "12A", "PG-13")
   - 'numberof_ratings' is stored as a string with parentheses (e.g., "(2.9M)")

b) Missing data:
   - 'Metascore' has 158 null values (15.8% of the data)
   - 'age_limit' has 3 null values (0.3% of the data)

c) Inconsistent formatting:
   - Movie names have leading spaces
   - Some titles use special characters (e.g., accented letters, apostrophes)

d) Potential outliers or data entry errors:
   - The year range (1920-2024) includes a future date
   - Some movies might have unusually long durations

3. Suggestions for data cleaning and normalization:

a) Data type conversion:
   - Convert 'duration' to minutes (integer)
   - Standardize 'age_limit' to a consistent format (e.g., convert all to MPAA ratings)
   - Convert 'numberof_ratings' to integer values
   - Ensure 'year' is an integer and remove any future dates

b) Handle missing data:
   - Decide whether to impute missing Metascores or drop those rows
   - Investigate and fill in missing age limits if possible

c) Text normalization:
   - Remove leading/trailing spaces from movie names
   - Consider normalizing special characters in titles
   - Standardize case (e.g., title case for movie names)

d) Create derived features:
   - Extract decade from the year
   - Create categories for movie duration (e.g., short, medium, long)
   - Bin ratings and Metascores into categories

e) Data validation:
   - Check for and handle any duplicate entries
   - Verify extreme values in numerical columns (e.g., very long durations)
   - Ensure all years are within a realistic range

f) Consistent formatting:
   - Format floats to a standard number of decimal places
   - Ensure consistent use of abbreviations (e.g., for age ratings)

g) Consider creating lookup tables:
   - For genres (if available in the description)
   - For age ratings to standardize across different systems

By addressing these issues and implementing these suggestions, you'll have a cleaner, more consistent dataset that's easier to analyze and use for various purposes, such as machine learning models or statistical analysis.
