Based on the following data analysis, generate SQL transformations to address the identified issues and implement the suggested improvements:

        Thank you for providing this detailed CSV structure. I'll analyze it and provide insights as requested.

1. Summary of the data:

This dataset appears to contain information about 1000 movies, likely from a movie rating or review platform. The columns include:

- rank: Movie ranking (1-1000)
- year: Release year of the movie (1920-2024)
- duration: Length of the movie (in hours and minutes)
- age_limit: Age rating or restriction
- rating: Movie rating (7.6-9.3 scale)
- numberof_ratings: Number of ratings received (in thousands or millions)
- Metascore: Another rating system (28-100 scale)
- description: Brief synopsis of the movie plot
- name: Movie title

2. Potential data quality issues:

a) Missing data:
   - Metascore has 158 null values (15.8% of the data)
   - age_limit has 3 null values (0.3% of the data)

b) Inconsistent formats:
   - duration is stored as a string (e.g., "2h 22m") instead of a numeric value
   - numberof_ratings is stored as a string with parentheses (e.g., "(2.9M)")
   - age_limit has mixed formats (numbers, letters, and text)

c) Potential outliers or errors:
   - year ranges from 1920 to 2024, which includes future dates
   - Some movie titles have leading spaces

d) Ambiguous data:
   - It's unclear what scale or criteria the 'rank' is based on
   - The source of 'Metascore' is not specified

3. Suggestions for data cleaning and normalization:

a) Handle missing data:
   - Decide whether to impute, remove, or flag missing Metascore and age_limit values

b) Standardize formats:
   - Convert duration to minutes (integer)
   - Extract numeric values from numberof_ratings and convert to actual numbers
   - Normalize age_limit to a consistent format (e.g., numeric age or standard rating system)

c) Date/Time handling:
   - Validate and correct any future years in the 'year' column
   - Consider converting 'year' to datetime format for easier analysis

d) Text cleaning:
   - Remove leading/trailing spaces from movie titles
   - Ensure consistent capitalization in text fields

e) Data type conversion:
   - Convert 'rank', 'year', 'rating', and 'Metascore' to appropriate numeric types

f) Add derived columns:
   - Create a 'decade' column from 'year' for easier grouping
   - Calculate the difference between 'rating' and normalized 'Metascore' for comparison

g) Normalization:
   - Consider normalizing 'rating' and 'Metascore' to a common scale for fair comparison

h) Documentation:
   - Add metadata to explain the sources and criteria for 'rank', 'rating', and 'Metascore'
   - Document any assumptions or changes made during the cleaning process

i) Validation:
   - Implement data validation checks to ensure data integrity after cleaning
   - Cross-reference with external sources to verify accuracy of movie information

By addressing these issues and implementing these suggestions, you'll have a cleaner, more consistent, and more analyzable dataset for your movie analysis projects.

        Please provide:
        1. SQL statements for data cleaning
        2. SQL statements for data normalization
        3. Any additional SQL transformations that would improve data quality

AI Response:
Certainly! I'll provide SQL statements for data cleaning, normalization, and additional transformations to improve data quality based on the analysis. These statements assume you're using a SQL database that supports common functions and window functions (e.g., PostgreSQL).

1. SQL statements for data cleaning:

```sql
-- Remove leading/trailing spaces from movie titles
UPDATE movies
SET name = TRIM(name);

-- Convert duration to minutes
UPDATE movies
SET duration = 
    CAST(SPLIT_PART(duration, 'h', 1) AS INTEGER) * 60 +
    COALESCE(NULLIF(REGEXP_REPLACE(SPLIT_PART(duration, 'h', 2), '[^0-9]', ''), ''), '0')::INTEGER;

-- Extract numeric values from numberof_ratings and convert to actual numbers
UPDATE movies
SET numberof_ratings = 
    CASE 
        WHEN numberof_ratings LIKE '%(%)%' THEN
            CASE 
                WHEN numberof_ratings LIKE '%M%' THEN REPLACE(REPLACE(numberof_ratings, '(', ''), 'M)', '')::FLOAT * 1000000
                WHEN numberof_ratings LIKE '%K%' THEN REPLACE(REPLACE(numberof_ratings, '(', ''), 'K)', '')::FLOAT * 1000
                ELSE REPLACE(REPLACE(numberof_ratings, '(', ''), ')', '')::FLOAT
            END
        ELSE numberof_ratings::FLOAT
    END;

-- Normalize age_limit (assuming we want to convert to numeric age)
UPDATE movies
SET age_limit = 
    CASE 
        WHEN age_limit = 'G' THEN '0'
        WHEN age_limit = 'PG' THEN '7'
        WHEN age_limit = 'PG-13' THEN '13'
        WHEN age_limit = 'R' THEN '17'
        WHEN age_limit = 'NC-17' THEN '18'
        ELSE REGEXP_REPLACE(age_limit, '[^0-9]', '')
    END;

-- Validate and correct future years
UPDATE movies
SET year = 
    CASE 
        WHEN year > EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) THEN NULL
        ELSE year
    END;

-- Convert columns to appropriate data types
ALTER TABLE movies
ALTER COLUMN rank TYPE INTEGER USING rank::INTEGER,
ALTER COLUMN year TYPE INTEGER USING year::INTEGER,
ALTER COLUMN duration TYPE INTEGER USING duration::INTEGER,
ALTER COLUMN age_limit TYPE INTEGER USING age_limit::INTEGER,
ALTER COLUMN rating TYPE FLOAT USING rating::FLOAT,
ALTER COLUMN numberof_ratings TYPE BIGINT USING numberof_ratings::BIGINT,
ALTER COLUMN Metascore TYPE INTEGER USING Metascore::INTEGER;
```

2. SQL statements for data normalization:

```sql
-- Create a decade column
ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN decade INTEGER;
UPDATE movies SET decade = year - (year % 10);

-- Normalize rating and Metascore to a 0-100 scale
ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN normalized_rating FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN normalized_metascore FLOAT;

UPDATE movies
SET normalized_rating = (rating - 7.6) / (9.3 - 7.6) * 100,
    normalized_metascore = Metascore;

-- Calculate the difference between normalized rating and Metascore
ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN rating_metascore_diff FLOAT;
UPDATE movies
SET rating_metascore_diff = normalized_rating - normalized_metascore;
```

3. Additional SQL transformations to improve data quality:

```sql
-- Create a view with non-null Metascores for analysis
CREATE VIEW movies_with_metascore AS
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE Metascore IS NOT NULL;

-- Add a column to flag movies with missing Metascores
ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN missing_metascore BOOLEAN;
UPDATE movies
SET missing_metascore = (Metascore IS NULL);

-- Create a column for release recency
ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN years_since_release INTEGER;
UPDATE movies
SET years_since_release = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM
