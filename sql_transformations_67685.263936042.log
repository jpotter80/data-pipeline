        Thank you for providing this detailed dataset information. I'll analyze it and provide a summary, potential data quality issues, and suggestions for data cleaning and normalization.

1. Summary of the data:

This dataset appears to be a collection of information about 1000 movies. It includes the following columns:
- rank: The ranking of the movie (1-1000)
- year: The release year of the movie
- duration: The length of the movie
- age_limit: Age rating or restriction
- rating: Numeric rating (likely out of 10)
- numberof_ratings: Number of people who rated the movie
- Metascore: Another rating system (0-100)
- description: A brief synopsis of the movie
- name: The title of the movie

The data covers a wide range of years, from 1920 to 2024, and includes various movie genres and ratings.

2. Potential data quality issues:

a) Inconsistent data types:
   - 'duration' is stored as an object (string) instead of a numeric type
   - 'age_limit' is stored as an object and contains mixed data (numbers and letters)
   - 'numberof_ratings' is stored as an object with parentheses

b) Missing data:
   - 'Metascore' has 158 null values (15.8% of the data)
   - 'age_limit' has 3 null values

c) Inconsistent formatting:
   - 'name' column has leading spaces in some entries
   - 'numberof_ratings' is formatted with parentheses and 'K' or 'M' for thousands/millions

d) Potential duplicates:
   - Some movies might have sequels or remakes with similar titles

e) Outliers or unusual values:
   - 'year' column has values up to 2024, which might be future releases
   - Some 'duration' values might be unusually long or short

3. Suggestions for data cleaning and normalization:

a) Data type conversion:
   - Convert 'duration' to numeric by extracting minutes (e.g., '2h 22m' to 142)
   - Standardize 'age_limit' to a consistent format (e.g., convert all to PG, PG-13, R, etc.)
   - Convert 'numberof_ratings' to numeric by removing parentheses and converting K/M to actual numbers

b) Handle missing data:
   - Decide whether to impute missing Metascores or drop those rows
   - Research missing age limits and fill them if possible

c) Text normalization:
   - Strip leading/trailing spaces from 'name' column
   - Ensure consistent capitalization in 'name' and 'description' columns

d) Deduplication:
   - Check for and handle any duplicate entries, considering sequels/remakes

e) Date handling:
   - Verify and correct any future dates in the 'year' column

f) Outlier detection:
   - Identify and verify any unusually long or short durations
   - Check for any abnormally high or low ratings

g) Feature engineering:
   - Create a 'decade' column from the 'year' for easier analysis
   - Extract genres from the 'description' if possible

h) Consistency checks:
   - Ensure 'rank' is unique and matches the number of rows
   - Verify that 'rating' and 'Metascore' are consistent (e.g., high rating should generally correspond to high Metascore)

i) Standardize column names:
   - Rename 'numberof_ratings' to 'number_of_ratings' for consistency

By addressing these issues and implementing these suggestions, you'll have a cleaner, more consistent dataset that's better suited for analysis and modeling.

        Please provide:
        1. SQL statements for data cleaning
        2. SQL statements for data normalization
        3. Any additional SQL transformations that would improve data quality

AI Response:
Certainly! I'll provide SQL statements for data cleaning, normalization, and additional transformations to improve data quality based on the analysis. Let's assume the table name is 'movies'.

1. SQL statements for data cleaning:

```sql
-- Convert duration to minutes
UPDATE movies
SET duration = CAST(SUBSTRING(duration, 1, POSITION('h' IN duration) - 1) AS INTEGER) * 60 +
               CAST(SUBSTRING(duration, POSITION('h' IN duration) + 1, POSITION('m' IN duration) - POSITION('h' IN duration) - 1) AS INTEGER);

-- Standardize age_limit
UPDATE movies
SET age_limit = CASE
    WHEN age_limit LIKE '%PG-13%' THEN 'PG-13'
    WHEN age_limit LIKE '%PG%' THEN 'PG'
    WHEN age_limit LIKE '%R%' THEN 'R'
    WHEN age_limit LIKE '%G%' THEN 'G'
    WHEN age_limit LIKE '%NC-17%' THEN 'NC-17'
    ELSE 'Not Rated'
END;

-- Convert numberof_ratings to numeric
UPDATE movies
SET numberof_ratings = CASE
    WHEN numberof_ratings LIKE '%M%' THEN CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(numberof_ratings, 'M', ''), '(', '') AS NUMERIC) * 1000000
    WHEN numberof_ratings LIKE '%K%' THEN CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(numberof_ratings, 'K', ''), '(', '') AS NUMERIC) * 1000
    ELSE CAST(REPLACE(numberof_ratings, '(', '') AS NUMERIC)
END;

-- Strip leading/trailing spaces from name
UPDATE movies
SET name = TRIM(name);

-- Handle future dates
UPDATE movies
SET year = CASE
    WHEN year > EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) THEN NULL
    ELSE year
END;

-- Rename numberof_ratings column
ALTER TABLE movies
RENAME COLUMN numberof_ratings TO number_of_ratings;
```

2. SQL statements for data normalization:

```sql
-- Create a separate genres table
CREATE TABLE genres (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    genre_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE
);

-- Extract genres from description and insert into genres table
INSERT INTO genres (genre_name)
SELECT DISTINCT unnest(regexp_matches(description, '(Action|Adventure|Animation|Biography|Comedy|Crime|Drama|Family|Fantasy|History|Horror|Music|Musical|Mystery|Romance|Sci-Fi|Sport|Thriller|War|Western)', 'g'))
FROM movies;

-- Create a movie_genres junction table
CREATE TABLE movie_genres (
    movie_id INTEGER REFERENCES movies(rank),
    genre_id INTEGER REFERENCES genres(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (movie_id, genre_id)
);

-- Populate movie_genres table
INSERT INTO movie_genres (movie_id, genre_id)
SELECT m.rank, g.id
FROM movies m
CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(regexp_matches(m.description, '(Action|Adventure|Animation|Biography|Comedy|Crime|Drama|Family|Fantasy|History|Horror|Music|Musical|Mystery|Romance|Sci-Fi|Sport|Thriller|War|Western)', 'g')) AS genre(name)
JOIN genres g ON g.genre_name = genre.name;

-- Create a separate directors table
CREATE TABLE directors (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    director_name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

-- Extract directors from description and insert into directors table
INSERT INTO directors (director_name)
SELECT DISTINCT regexp_replace(regexp_matches(description, 'Directed by ([^.]+)', 'g')::text, '[{}]', '', 'g')
FROM movies
WHERE description LIKE '%Directed by%';

-- Create a movie_directors junction table
CREATE TABLE movie_directors (
    movie_id INTEGER REFERENCES movies(rank),
    director_id INTEGER REFERENCES directors(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (movie_id, director_id)
);

-- Populate movie_directors table
INSERT INTO movie_directors (movie_id, director_id)
SELECT m.rank, d.id
