Based on the following data analysis, generate SQL transformations to address the identified issues and implement the suggested improvements:

        Thank you for providing this detailed information about the CSV structure. I'll provide a summary, discuss potential data quality issues, and offer suggestions for data cleaning and normalization.

1. Summary of the data:

This dataset appears to be a collection of information about 1000 movies, including:
- Ranking
- Release year
- Duration
- Age limit
- Rating
- Number of ratings
- Metascore
- Description
- Movie name

Key observations:
- The data spans movies from 1920 to 2024
- Ratings range from 7.6 to 9.3
- Metascores range from 28 to 100
- The dataset includes a mix of numerical and categorical data

2. Potential data quality issues:

a) Inconsistent data types:
   - 'duration' is stored as a string (e.g., "2h 22m") instead of a numerical value
   - 'age_limit' is stored as a string with mixed formats (e.g., "15", "12A", "PG-13")
   - 'numberof_ratings' is stored as a string with parentheses (e.g., "(2.9M)")

b) Missing data:
   - 'Metascore' has 158 null values (15.8% of the data)
   - 'age_limit' has 3 null values (0.3% of the data)

c) Inconsistent formatting:
   - Movie names have leading spaces
   - Some titles use special characters (e.g., accented letters, apostrophes)

d) Potential outliers or data entry errors:
   - The year range (1920-2024) includes a future date
   - Some movies might have unusually long durations

3. Suggestions for data cleaning and normalization:

a) Data type conversion:
   - Convert 'duration' to minutes (integer)
   - Standardize 'age_limit' to a consistent format (e.g., convert all to MPAA ratings)
   - Convert 'numberof_ratings' to integer values
   - Ensure 'year' is an integer and remove any future dates

b) Handle missing data:
   - Decide whether to impute missing Metascores or drop those rows
   - Investigate and fill in missing age limits if possible

c) Text normalization:
   - Remove leading/trailing spaces from movie names
   - Consider normalizing special characters in titles
   - Standardize case (e.g., title case for movie names)

d) Create derived features:
   - Extract decade from the year
   - Create categories for movie duration (e.g., short, medium, long)
   - Bin ratings and Metascores into categories

e) Data validation:
   - Check for and handle any duplicate entries
   - Verify extreme values in numerical columns (e.g., very long durations)
   - Ensure all years are within a realistic range

f) Consistent formatting:
   - Format floats to a standard number of decimal places
   - Ensure consistent use of abbreviations (e.g., for age ratings)

g) Consider creating lookup tables:
   - For genres (if available in the description)
   - For age ratings to standardize across different systems

By addressing these issues and implementing these suggestions, you'll have a cleaner, more consistent dataset that's easier to analyze and use for various purposes, such as machine learning models or statistical analysis.

        Please provide:
        1. SQL statements for data cleaning
        2. SQL statements for data normalization
        3. Any additional SQL transformations that would improve data quality

AI Response:
Based on the data analysis provided, I'll generate SQL transformations to address the identified issues and implement the suggested improvements. I'll assume we're working with a table named 'movies' in a SQL database.

1. SQL statements for data cleaning:

```sql
-- Remove leading/trailing spaces from movie names
UPDATE movies
SET movie_name = TRIM(movie_name);

-- Convert duration to minutes
UPDATE movies
SET duration = 
    CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(duration, 'h', 1) AS UNSIGNED) * 60 +
    COALESCE(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(duration, 'h ', -1), 'm', 1) AS UNSIGNED), 0);

-- Convert numberof_ratings to integer
UPDATE movies
SET numberof_ratings = CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(numberof_ratings, '(', ''), ')', '') AS UNSIGNED);

-- Remove future dates
UPDATE movies
SET year = NULL
WHERE year > YEAR(CURRENT_DATE());

-- Handle missing data
UPDATE movies
SET metascore = NULL
WHERE metascore = '';

UPDATE movies
SET age_limit = 'Not Rated'
WHERE age_limit IS NULL OR age_limit = '';
```

2. SQL statements for data normalization:

```sql
-- Standardize age_limit to MPAA ratings (this is a simplified version and may need adjustment)
UPDATE movies
SET age_limit = 
    CASE 
        WHEN age_limit IN ('G', 'TV-G') THEN 'G'
        WHEN age_limit IN ('PG', 'TV-PG') THEN 'PG'
        WHEN age_limit IN ('PG-13', 'TV-14') THEN 'PG-13'
        WHEN age_limit IN ('R', 'TV-MA', '18') THEN 'R'
        WHEN age_limit IN ('NC-17') THEN 'NC-17'
        ELSE 'Not Rated'
    END;

-- Normalize movie names (convert to title case)
UPDATE movies
SET movie_name = CONCAT(
    UPPER(SUBSTRING(movie_name, 1, 1)),
    LOWER(SUBSTRING(movie_name, 2))
);

-- Round rating and metascore to 1 decimal place
UPDATE movies
SET rating = ROUND(rating, 1),
    metascore = ROUND(metascore, 1);
```

3. Additional SQL transformations to improve data quality:

```sql
-- Create a decade column
ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN decade INT;
UPDATE movies
SET decade = FLOOR(year / 10) * 10;

-- Create a duration category column
ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN duration_category VARCHAR(10);
UPDATE movies
SET duration_category = 
    CASE 
        WHEN duration < 90 THEN 'Short'
        WHEN duration >= 90 AND duration < 120 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Long'
    END;

-- Create rating and metascore categories
ALTER TABLE movies 
ADD COLUMN rating_category VARCHAR(10),
ADD COLUMN metascore_category VARCHAR(10);

UPDATE movies
SET rating_category = 
    CASE 
        WHEN rating < 8.0 THEN 'Good'
        WHEN rating >= 8.0 AND rating < 8.5 THEN 'Very Good'
        ELSE 'Excellent'
    END,
    metascore_category = 
    CASE 
        WHEN metascore < 60 THEN 'Mixed'
        WHEN metascore >= 60 AND metascore < 80 THEN 'Positive'
        ELSE 'Must-See'
    END;

-- Create a unique identifier for each movie
ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN movie_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;

-- Remove duplicate entries (if any)
CREATE TABLE movies_deduplicated AS
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM movies;

DROP TABLE movies;
ALTER TABLE movies_deduplicated RENAME TO movies;

-- Create an index on movie_name for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_movie_name ON movies (movie_name);
```

These SQL transformations address the main issues identified in the data analysis:
1. They clean the data by removing inconsist
