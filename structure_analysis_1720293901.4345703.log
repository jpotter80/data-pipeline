        Please provide:
        1. A summary of the data
        2. Potential data quality issues
        3. Suggestions for data cleaning and normalization

AI Response:
Thank you for providing this detailed CSV structure. I'll analyze it and provide insights as requested.

1. Summary of the data:

This dataset appears to contain information about 1000 movies, likely from a movie rating or review platform. The columns include:

- rank: Movie ranking (1-1000)
- year: Release year of the movie (1920-2024)
- duration: Length of the movie (in hours and minutes)
- age_limit: Age rating or restriction
- rating: Movie rating (7.6-9.3 scale)
- numberof_ratings: Number of ratings received (in thousands or millions)
- Metascore: Another rating system (28-100 scale)
- description: Brief synopsis of the movie plot
- name: Movie title

2. Potential data quality issues:

a) Missing data:
   - Metascore has 158 null values (15.8% of the data)
   - age_limit has 3 null values (0.3% of the data)

b) Inconsistent formats:
   - duration is stored as a string (e.g., "2h 22m") instead of a numeric value
   - numberof_ratings is stored as a string with parentheses (e.g., "(2.9M)")
   - age_limit has mixed formats (numbers, letters, and text)

c) Potential outliers or errors:
   - year ranges from 1920 to 2024, which includes future dates
   - Some movie titles have leading spaces

d) Ambiguous data:
   - It's unclear what scale or criteria the 'rank' is based on
   - The source of 'Metascore' is not specified

3. Suggestions for data cleaning and normalization:

a) Handle missing data:
   - Decide whether to impute, remove, or flag missing Metascore and age_limit values

b) Standardize formats:
   - Convert duration to minutes (integer)
   - Extract numeric values from numberof_ratings and convert to actual numbers
   - Normalize age_limit to a consistent format (e.g., numeric age or standard rating system)

c) Date/Time handling:
   - Validate and correct any future years in the 'year' column
   - Consider converting 'year' to datetime format for easier analysis

d) Text cleaning:
   - Remove leading/trailing spaces from movie titles
   - Ensure consistent capitalization in text fields

e) Data type conversion:
   - Convert 'rank', 'year', 'rating', and 'Metascore' to appropriate numeric types

f) Add derived columns:
   - Create a 'decade' column from 'year' for easier grouping
   - Calculate the difference between 'rating' and normalized 'Metascore' for comparison

g) Normalization:
   - Consider normalizing 'rating' and 'Metascore' to a common scale for fair comparison

h) Documentation:
   - Add metadata to explain the sources and criteria for 'rank', 'rating', and 'Metascore'
   - Document any assumptions or changes made during the cleaning process

i) Validation:
   - Implement data validation checks to ensure data integrity after cleaning
   - Cross-reference with external sources to verify accuracy of movie information

By addressing these issues and implementing these suggestions, you'll have a cleaner, more consistent, and more analyzable dataset for your movie analysis projects.
